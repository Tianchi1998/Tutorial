This is
my attempt at
Tut 8, problem 2

the last line was empty
I'm very happy yesterday
and I love the 13th games of People Republic of China so much!
There are many hardships in the future
But I will be a winner finally!
Just fight!
Against all the difficulties!

I will go to the Massey University in my fourth year of my undergraduate.
I'm very excited for that!
